# Tree from object
Write a function `createTree(element, data)` that creates a nested list of `ul/li` from an object.
Use keys as list items.

`element` - is a DOM element

`data` - is a nested object

> Hint: use [Recursion](https://javascript.info/recursion)

### Styling with SCSS ðŸŽ¨
This project uses Parcel, which automatically handles the compilation of SCSS to CSS out of the box.

You do not need to manually compile your .scss files. Simply link your main SCSS file directly in your HTML, and Parcel will take care of the rest.
